title: Heading
info: Headings are used to highlight sections of content.
---

Headings are used on each subpage to highlight, what the page is about.
We either use the h1, h2 or h3 tag. Where h1 and h2 are using the Inconsolata font for highlighting and the h3 the Roboto font.

{% include pattern_block.html url='/src/patterns/components/heading/headline-1-3.html' %}
Headlines 1 - 3 are larger than the body text and are reserved for short, important text.

{% include pattern_block.html url='/src/patterns/components/heading/subtitle.html' %}
A Subtitle can be used directly after a Headline e.g. on the start page for the intro.
