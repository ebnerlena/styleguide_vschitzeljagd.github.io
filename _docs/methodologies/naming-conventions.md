## BEM Naming Convention
In our CSS we try to stick to the BEM naming conventions by using block-element_modifier syntax for classes.
The classes are useful as than all elemtents are in the same hierachy.

## Example
Todo: use own example
```
<!-- `header` block -->
<header class="header">
    <!-- Nested `logo` block -->
    <div class="logo"></div>

    <!-- Nested `search-form` block -->
    <form class="search-form"></form>
</header>
```
