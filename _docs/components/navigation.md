title: Navigation
info: We use a topbar navigation.

Navigation is used to bundle all basic actions of the app to one point. It should be clearly visible to the user on every page and some actions should also be familiar to them, e.g. click on logo to navigate to the home screen.

{% include pattern_block.html url='/src/patterns/components/navigation/nav.html' %}
This is what the normal navigation looks like.

{% include pattern_block.html url='/src/patterns/components/navigation/nav_home.html' %}
This navigation is used on the start screen, where also our logo is placed as back-link.

{% include pattern_block.html url='/src/patterns/components/navigation/nav_back.html' %}
In this navigation the user is able to go back to the page where he came from.
